# MDAvatars

    Welcome to MDavatars you can follow the development here, i'll update this README later 
    to show you how to use and add SVG kit to this app.
    
###CREATE YOUR OWN KIT
Lets start ! to create your own kit you need to provide to the app your SVG file. I'm using 
Adobe Illustrator cc here
We will start from scratch with the android one :

![Android SVG](/../master/illustrator_1.png?raw=true "Android SVG")


You have many tutos on the web to show you how to make correct svg for android apps. for now 
you have to be sure to name all component of your svg path/group as below : 

![Android SVG](/../master/illustrator_2.png?raw=true "Android SVG")


After this you can save your file with #crtl + alt + S. Be sure to select SVG Basic 1.1 or Tiny 2.1
You can compare the svg code

![Android SVG](/../master/illustrator_3.png?raw=true "Android SVG")
